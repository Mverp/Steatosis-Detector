# Steatosis-Measurer
A Fiji plugin for measuring the amount of steatosis in whole slide images of liver tissue.

(05-2021) Due to a major update in the Pathomation software, the Steatosis-Measurer sadly is no longer functional. Currently there are no plans to refactor the plugin.

## Requirements
- Fiji image processing package (https://fiji.sc/)
- OpenCV library for computer vision functionality (https://opencv.org/)
- PMA.start, a free local image server by Pathomation (https://free.pathomation.com/)

Please consult the manual for the installation and use of the plugin.
